abstract = {Measuring the User Experience was the first book that focused on how to quantify the user experience. Now in the second edition, the authors include new material on how recent technologies have made it easier and more effective to collect a broader range of data about the user experience. As more UX and web professionals need to justify their design decisions with solid, reliable data, Measuring the User Experience provides the quantitative analysis training that these professionals need. The second edition presents new metrics such as emotional engagement, personas, keystroke analysis, and net promoter score. It also examines how new technologies coming from neuro-marketing and online market research can refine user experience measurement, helping usability and user experience practitioners make business cases to stakeholders. The book also contains new research and updated examples, including tips on writing online survey questions, six new case studies, and examples using the most recent version of Excel.Learn which metrics to select for every case, including behavioral, physiological, emotional, aesthetic, gestural, verbal, and physical, as well as more specialized metrics such as eye-tracking and clickstream data.Find a vendor-neutral examination of how to measure the user experience with web sites, digital products, and virtually any other type of product or system. Discover in-depth global case studies showing how organizations have successfully used metrics and the information they revealed.Companion site, www.measuringux.com, includes articles, tools, spreadsheets, presentations, and other resources to help you effectively measure the user experience},

abstract = {In bats and technological sonars, the gain of the receiver is progressively increased with time after the transmission of a signal to compensate for acoustic propagation loss. The current understanding of dolphin echolocation indicates that automatic gain control is not a part of their sonar system. In order to test this understanding, we have performed field measurements of free-ranging echolocating dolphins. Here we show that dolphins do possess an automatic gain control mechanism, but that it is implemented in the transmission phase rather than the receiving phase of a sonar cycle. We find that the amplitude of the dolphins' echolocation signals are highly range dependent; this amplitude increases with increasing target range, R, in a 20 log(R) fashion to compensate for propagation loss. If the echolocation target is a fish school with many sound scatterers, the echoes from the school will remain nearly constant with range as the dolphin closes in on it. This characteristic has the same effect as time-varying gain in bats and technological sonar when considered from a sonar system perspective.},

abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.},

abstract = {The circumplex model of affect construes all emotions as linear combinations of 2 independent neurophysiological dimensions, valence and arousal. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural networks subserving valence and arousal, and we assessed, in 10 participants, the associations of the BOLD (blood oxygen level-dependent) response, an indirect index of neural activity, with ratings of valence and arousal during the emotional experiences induced by the presentation of evocative sentences. Unpleasant emotional experience was associated with increased BOLD signal intensities in the supplementary motor, anterior midcingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal, occipito-temporal, inferior parietal, and cerebellar cortices. Highly arousing emotions were associated with increased BOLD signal intensities in the left thalamus, globus pallidus, caudate, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, premotor cortex, and cerebellar vermis. Separate analyses using a finite impulse response model confirmed these results and revealed that pleasant emotions engaged an additional network that included the midbrain, ventral striatum, and caudate nucleus, all portions of a reward circuit. These findings suggest the existence of distinct networks subserving the valence and arousal dimensions of emotions, with midline and medial temporal lobe structures mediating arousal and dorsal cortical areas and mesolimbic pathways mediating valence.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effect of attention on the contrast response curves of steady-state visual evoked potentials (VEPs) to counter-phased sinusoidal gratings. The 1 cyc/deg gratings were modulated either in luminance or chromaticity (equiluminant red-green). The luminance grating counter-phased at 9 Hz (to favour activation of the magno-cellular system), and the chromatic grating at 2.5 Hz (to favour activation of the parvo-cellular system). Attention was directed towards the gratings (displayed in the left visual field) by requiring subjects to detect and respond to randomly occurring changes in contrast. In the control condition, attention towards the grating was minimised by requiring subjects to detect a target letter amongst distracters briefly flashed in the contra-lateral visual field. Attention increased VEP amplitudes for both luminance and chromatic stimuli, more so at high than at low contrasts, increasing the slope of the contrast amplitude curves (over the non-saturating range of contrasts). The estimates of contrast threshold from extrapolation of amplitudes were unaffected by attention. Attention also changed the VEP phases, but only for luminance gratings, where it acted to reduce the magnitude of phase advance with contrast. Attention had no effect on the average phases for chromatic gratings. The results are consistent with the notion that attention acts on cortical gain control mechanisms, which are known to be different for the magno- and parvo-cellular systems.},

abstract = {The primary aim of the present study was to systematically compare perceived emotions in music using two different theoretical frameworks: the discrete emotion model, and the dimensional model of affect. A secondary aim was to introduce a new, improved set of stimuli for the study of music-mediated emotions. A large pilot study established a set of 110 film music excerpts, half were moderately and highly representative examples of five discrete emotions (anger, fear, sadness, happiness and tenderness), and the other half moderate and high examples of the six extremes of three bipolar dimensions (valence, energy arousal and tension arousal). These excerpts were rated in a listening experiment by 116 non-musicians. All target emotions of highly representative examples in both conceptual sets were discriminated by self-ratings. Linear mapping techniques between the discrete and dimensional models revealed a high correspondence along two central dimensions that can be labelled as valence and arousal, and the three dimensions could be reduced to two without significantly reducing the goodness of fit. The major difference between the discrete and categorical models concerned the poorer resolution of the discrete model in characterizing emotionally ambiguous examples. The study offers systematically structured and rich stimulus material for exploring emotional processing.},

abstract = {A new method for the estimation of multiple concurrent pitches in piano recordings is presented. It addresses the issue of overlapping overtones by modeling the spectral envelope of the overtones of each note with a smooth autoregressive model. For the background noise, a moving-average model is used and the combination of both tends to eliminate harmonic and sub-harmonic erroneous pitch estimations. This leads to a complete generative spectral model for simultaneous piano notes, which also explicitly includes the typical deviation from exact harmonicity in a piano overtone series. The pitch set which maximizes an approximate likelihood is selected from among a restricted number of possible pitch combinations as the one. Tests have been conducted on a large homemade database called MAPS, composed of piano recordings from a real upright piano and from high-quality samples.},

Empirical studies of emotion perception are briefly reviewed with regard to listener agreement concerning expressed emotions, followed by a selective review of empirical studies on emotional response to music. Possible relationships between emotion perception and emotional response are discussed and exemplified: Positive relationship, negative relationship, no systematic relationship and no relationship. It is emphasised that both emotion perception and, especially, emotional response are dependent on an interplay between musical, personal, and situational factors. Some methodological questions and suggestions for further research are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents a general probabilistic model for transcribing single-channel music recordings containing multiple polyphonic instrument sources. The system requires no prior knowledge of the instruments present in the mixture (other than the number), although it can benefit from information about instrument type if available. In contrast to many existing polyphonic transcription systems, our approach explicitly models the individual instruments and is thereby able to assign detected notes to their respective sources. We use training instruments to learn a set of linear manifolds in model parameter space which are then used during transcription to constrain the properties of models fit to the target mixture. This leads to a hierarchical mixture-of-subspaces design which makes it possible to supply the system with prior knowledge at different levels of abstraction. The proposed technique is evaluated on both recorded and synthesized mixtures containing two, three, four, and five instruments each. We compare our approach in terms of transcription with (i.e., detected pitches must be associated with the correct instrument) and without source-assignment to another multi-instrument transcription system as well as a baseline non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. For two-instrument mixtures evaluated with source-assignment, we obtain average frame-level F-measures of up to 0.52 in the completely blind transcription setting (i.e., no prior knowledge of the instruments in the mixture) and up to 0.67 if we assume knowledge of the basic instrument types. For transcription without source assignment, these numbers rise to 0.76 and 0.83, respectively.},

@article{Guna2014,
abstract = {We present the results of an evaluation of the performance of the Leap Motion Controller with the aid of a professional, high-precision, fast motion tracking system. A set of static and dynamic measurements was performed with different numbers of tracking objects and configurations. For the static measurements, a plastic arm model simulating a human arm was used. A set of 37 reference locations was selected to cover the controller's sensory space. For the dynamic measurements, a special V-shaped tool, consisting of two tracking objects maintaining a constant distance between them, was created to simulate two human fingers. In the static scenario, the standard deviation was less than 0.5 mm. The linear correlation revealed a significant increase in the standard deviation when moving away from the controller. The results of the dynamic scenario revealed the inconsistent performance of the controller, with a significant drop in accuracy for samples taken more than 250 mm above the controller's surface. The Leap Motion Controller undoubtedly represents a revolutionary input device for gesture-based human-computer interaction; however, due to its rather limited sensory space and inconsistent sampling frequency, in its current configuration it cannot currently be used as a professional tracking system.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method that can identify challenging music samples for beat tracking without ground truth. Our method, motivated by the machine learning method “selective sampling,” is based on the measurement of mutual agreement between beat sequences. In calculating this mutual agreement we show the critical influence of different evaluation measures. Using our approach we demonstrate how to compile a new evaluation dataset comprised of difficult excerpts for beat tracking and examine this difficulty in the context of perceptual and musical properties. Based on tag analysis we indicate the musical properties where future advances in beat tracking research would be most profitable and where beat tracking is too difficult to be attempted. Finally, we demonstrate how our mutual agreement method can be used to improve beat tracking accuracy on large music collections.},

The transcription task is here understood as transforming an acoustic musical signal into a MIDI-like symbolic representation. Only pitched musical instruments are considered: recognizing the sounds of drum instruments is not discussed. The main emphasis is laid on estimating the multiple fundamental frequencies of several concurrent sounds. Various approaches to solve this problem are discussed, including methods that are based on modelling the human auditory periphery, methods that mimic the human auditory scene analysis function, signal model-based Bayesian inference methods, and data-adaptive methods. Another subproblem addressed is the rhythmic parsing of acoustic musical signals. From the transcription point of view, this amounts to the temporal segmentation of music signals at different time scales. The relationship between the two subproblems and the general structure of the transcription problem is discussed.

One obstacle to understanding has been the lack of a method to manipulate the intensity of hallucination during the course of experiment. Residual inhibition, transient suppression of a phantom percept after the offset of a masking stimulus, has been used in the study of tinnitus. We report here a human subject whose MH were residually inhibited by short periods of music. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) allowed us to examine variation in the underlying oscillatory brain activity in different states. Source-space analysis capable of single-subject inference defined left-lateralised power increases, associated with stronger hallucinations, in the gamma band in left anterior superior temporal gyrus, and in the beta band in motor cortex and posteromedial cortex. The data indicate that these areas form a crucial network in the generation of MH, and are consistent with a model in which MH are generated by persistent reciprocal communication in a predictive coding hierarchy.},

abstract = {In previous approaches to repetition discovery in music, the music to be analysed has been represented using strings. However, there are certain types of interesting musical repetitions that cannot be discovered using string algorithms. We propose a geometric approach to repetition discovery in which the music is represented as a multidimensional dataset. Certain types of interesting musical repetition that cannot be found using string algorithms can efficiently be found using algorithms that process multidimensional datasets. Our approach allows polyphonic music to be analysed as efficiently as monophonic music and it can be used to discover polyphonic repeated patterns ?with gaps? in the timbre, dynamic and rhythmic structure of a passage as well as its pitch structure. We present two new algorithms: SIA and SIATEC. SIA computes all the maximal repeated patterns in a multidimensional dataset and SIATEC computes all the occurrences of all the maximal repeated patterns in a dataset. For a k -dimensional dataset of size n, the worstcase running time of SIA is O (kn 2 log 2 n) and the worst-case running time of SIATEC is O (kn 3).

abstract = {The circumplex model of affect has been among the most widely studied representations of affect. Despite the considerable evidence cited in support of it, methods typically used to evaluate the model have substantial limitations. In this article, the authors attempt to correct past limitations by using a covariance structure model specifically designed to assess circumplex structure. This model was fit to 47 individual correlation matrices from published data sets. Analyses revealed that model fit was typically acceptable and that opposing affective states usually demonstrated strong negative correlations with one another. However, analyses also indicated substantial variability in both model fit and correlations among opposing affective states and suggested several characteristics of studies that partially accounted for this variability. Detailed examination of the locations of affective states for 10 of the correlation matrices with relatively optimal characteristics provided mixed support for the model.},

abstract = {What makes people smarter than computers? The work described in these two volumes suggests that the answer lies in the massively parallel architecture of the human mind. It is some of the most exciting work in cognitive science, unifying neural and cognitive processes in a highly computational framework, with links to artificial intelligence. Although thought and problem solving have a sequential character when viewed over a time frame of minutes or hours, the authors argue that each step in the sequence is the result of the simultaneous activity of a large number of simple computational elements, each influencing others and being influenced by them. "Parallel Distributed Processing" describes their work in developing a theoretical framework for describing this parallel distributed processing activity and in applying the framework to the development of models of aspects of perception, memory, language, and thought. Volume 1 lays the theoretical foundations of parallel distributed processing. It introduces the approach and the reasons why the authors feel it is a fruitful one, describes several models of basic mechanisms with wide applicability to different problems, and presents a number of specific technical analyses of different aspects of parallel distributed models.},

abstract = {Melody extraction algorithms aim to produce a sequence of frequency values corresponding to the pitch of the dominant melody from a musical recording. Over the past decade, melody extraction has emerged as an active research topic, comprising a large variety of proposed algorithms spanning a wide range of techniques. This article provides an overview of these techniques, the applications for which melody extraction is useful, and the challenges that remain. We start with a discussion of ?melody? from both musical and signal processing perspectives and provide a case study that interprets the output of a melody extraction algorithm for specific excerpts. We then provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of melody extraction algorithms based on the results of an international evaluation campaign. We discuss issues of algorithm design, evaluation, and applications that build upon melody extraction. Finally, we discuss some of the remaining challenges in melody extraction research in terms of algorithmic performance, development, and evaluation methodology.},

abstract = {The medium of music has evolved specifically for the expression of emotions, and it is natural for us to organize music in terms of its emotional associations. But while such organization is a natural process for humans, quantifying it empirically proves to be a very difficult task, and as such no dominant feature representation for music emotion recognition has yet emerged. Much of the difficulty in developing emotion-based features is the ambiguity of the ground-truth. Even using the smallest time window, opinions on the emotion are bound to vary and reflect some disagreement between listeners. In previous work, we have modeled human response labels to music in the arousal-valence (A-V) representation of affect as a time-varying, stochastic distribution. Current methods for automatic detection of emotion in music seek performance increases by combining several feature domains (e.g. loudness, timbre, harmony, rhythm). Such work has focused largely in dimensionality reduction for minor classification performance gains, but has provided little insight into the relationship between audio and emotional associations. In this new work we seek to employ regression-based deep belief networks to learn features directly from magnitude spectra. While the system is applied to the specific problem of music emotion recognition, it could be easily applied to any regression-based audio feature learning problem.},

In this paper, we focus on the modeling of chord sequences by probabilistic N-grams. Previous studies using these models have achieved limited success, due to overfitting and to the use of a single chord labeling scheme. We investigate these issues using model smoothing and selection techniques initially designed for spoken language modeling. This approach is evaluated over a set of songs by The Beatles, considering several chord labeling schemes. Initial results show that the accuracy of N-grams is increased but that additional improvements may still be achieved in the future using more advanced, possibly music-specific, smoothing techniques.},

abstract = {Affective labeling of multimedia content has proved to be useful in recommender systems. In this paper we present a methodology for the implicit acquisition of affective labels for images. It is based on an emotion detection technique that takes as input the video sequences of the users' facial expressions. It extracts Gabor low level features from the video frames and employs a k nearest neighbors machine learning technique to generate affective labels in the valence-arousal-dominance space. We performed a comparative study of the performance of a content-based recommender (CBR) system for images that uses three types of metadata to model the users and the items: (i) generic metadata, (ii) explicitly acquired affective labels and (iii) implicitly acquired affective labels with the proposed methodology. The results show that the CBR performs best when explicit labels are used. However, implicitly acquired labels yield a significantly better performance of the CBR than generic metadata while being an unobtrusive feedback tool.},

abstract = {Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Genre hierarchies are commonly used to structure the large collections of music available on the Web. Currently musical genre annotation is performed manually. Automatic musical genre classification can assist or replace the human user in this process and would be a valuable addition to music information retrieval systems. In addition, automatic musical genre classification provides a framework for developing and evaluating features for any type of content-based analysis of musical signals. In this paper, the automatic classification of audio signals into an hierarchy of musical genres is explored. More specifically, three feature sets for representing timbral texture, rhythmic content and pitch content are proposed. The performance and relative importance of the proposed features is investigated by training statistical pattern recognition classifiers using real-world audio collections. Both whole file and real-time frame-based classification schemes are described. Using the proposed feature sets, classification of 61\% for ten musical genres is achieved. This result is comparable to results reported for human musical genre classification.},
